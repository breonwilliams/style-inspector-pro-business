### **Extension Authentication Flow:**
```javascript
// Extension checks subscription status
const response = await fetch('/api/extension/subscription/validate', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${userToken}` }
});

if (response.data.plan === 'pro') {
  // Unlock all premium features
  enablePremiumFeatures();
}
```

## 💳 **Payment Flow Details**
